I’m an early career PhD data scientist, and I’m in the rare position of having combined a rigorous understanding of applied statistics with strong skills in computer science, software engineering, and collaboration on technical projects. I have worked independently, as a researcher, project leader, and software developer, on multiple large exploratory and confirmatory analysis projects, and on research software development projects. I am great at working in messy unprocessed “big” data scenarios, involving local and cloud based SQL database management systems. I liaise with statisticians, scientists, medical professionals, and executives, and I work with local and international partners, to deliver analysis and pre-processing pipelines that deliver security, confidentiality, interactivity / usability, modularity / reusability, documentation, collaboration, and machine learning / statistical rigour.

I have written a handful of private and open source R packages, two of which are currently on CRAN. I teach meta‑analysis to Master’s students, and I teach database design and SQL programming to professional statisticians and social scientists. I also currently serve as a council member and executive privacy Officer at the Statistical Society of Australia, as well as technical sub‑editor at the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics. In my spare time I enjoy being a dad, camping, video games, exercise, tasty food, good conversation, and hobby programming in a variety of languages including Julia, Python, Java, Javascript, and C++.

Take a look at the material for my Intro to SQL course. You'll find thoughtful explanations, covering more than a typical beginner course, with many exercises and helpful diagrams. I've incorporated experiences over 4 years of university teaching, industry consulting, and many workshops, in Australia and New Zealand. github.com/frycast/SQL_Course
