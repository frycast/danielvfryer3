I've worked as a researcher, project leader and developer, on large industry and academic projects, with other developers, scientists, domain experts, various stakeholders, executives, and statisticians, locally, remotely and across international borders.

I'm fortunate to be satisfying my curiosity daily, with impressive people, bringing to the table my natural eye for detail, software engineering skills, passion for knowledge sharing, data and process architecture, and a rigorous understanding of statistics, machine learning and AI.

I enjoy making clean work of messy processes, involving multiple teams and interfaces, complicated risks, integrated data sources, tricky problems, SQL databases, and complex modelling. I think in terms of end-to-end processes and analyses that deliver stable and reliable tools and insights.

Most of my current research is in explainable AI, though I'm most interested in (1) relationships between uncertainty and decision making in Stats/ML/AI; (2) effective collaboration between teams of people on hard or complex tasks; and (3) intellectual integrity, education and healthy incentive schemes.

I love teaching things well, writing courses and books, teaching stats and meta‑analysis to Master of Data Science students, and teaching database design / SQL concepts to professional statisticians and scientists. I've also enjoyed being involved in open source development - writing a handful of open source R packages.

Currently serving as the executive privacy officer and database administrator, at the Statistical Society of Australia, as well as a technical sub-editor at the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics. 

In my spare time I enjoy being a dad, surfing, good conversation, and my own coding projects (in Julia, Python, R, SQL and a few other languages).

My Intro SQL course is delivered twice yearly for The University of Auckland, as well as once per year at the Statistical Society of Australia: github.com/frycast/SQL_Course

"Uncertainty is not an accident of the scientific method, but its substance" — Andrea Saltelli.

"An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem" — John Tukey.

"Whenever there is a simple error that most laymen fall for, there is always a slightly more sophisticated version of the same problem that experts fall for." - Amos Tverski
