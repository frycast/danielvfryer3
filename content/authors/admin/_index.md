Data analyses are increasingly being conducted with complicated, or 'black box', models. These models produce results that are hard to explain and interpret. I work to develop transparency, honesty, and clarity in scientific knowledge discovery, through research, teaching, software tools and communication.

Through my PhD I am accidentally becoming an expert in a thing called the Shapley value. I'm also interested (though not an expert) in economics, mental health, precision medicine, scientific integrity, communication of uncertainty, sustainable development and microalgae.

Aside from research, I enjoy coding in R, Python, Julia and SQL, I practice software engineering techniques and data integration, and I teach various courses in both statistics and computer science at a postgraduate level, including meta-analysis and database design. I currently serve as a council member and Deputy Communications Officer at the Statistical Society of Australia, as well as technical sub-editor at the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics.

Take a look at the material for my SQL crash course. It is targeted at academic and industry professionals. I teach the course twice per year, both online and in New Zealand, for the New Zealand Social Statistics Network, at The University of Auckland: github.com/frycast/SQL_Course

Fill out the contact form below if you'd like to get in touch. 
I'm always open to learning, teaching and working together.
