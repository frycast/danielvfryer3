Hi there. What brings you to these parts? I suppose you're here because you want to know about me!

I have expertise in software/data engineering, statistical modelling, machine learning and AI. I've worked as project lead, systems designer, developer and researcher on a variety of high-value projects.

I believe one of the biggest challenges in engineering is to not overcomplicate things - to pick the right problems and strip away complexity, not add more in. It's iterative, and it's hard (or impossible?) to get it "right". The goal posts naturally shift as requirements evolve.

In stats and machine learning, I focus a lot on uncertainty and decision making. Most models exist to help us make better and more informed decisions.

Underneath all that modelling, infrastructure "keeps the lights on" and captures enduring business logic, dealing with data lifecycle management, observability, collection, storage, orchestration, governance, interfaces, networks, security...

What keeps me engaged is that I always start from the assumption that there are simple solutions to our problems. I think solutions have enough in common that we should invest considerable time in improving how we go about finding and building them.

I also love teaching, writing courses and books. my favourite way to teach is in short workshops where I can design the full experience and all the material. I love getting to the end and knowing I've made the workshop worthwhile for the people who've attended.

In my spare time I enjoy being a dad, surfing, good conversation, and my own coding projects - currently spending some time learning Rust, TypeScript, React and more cloud services (mostly AWS) for data engineering and generative AI.

"Uncertainty is not an accident of the scientific method, but its substance" — Andrea Saltelli.

"An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem" — John Tukey.

"Whenever there is a simple error that most laymen fall for, there is always a slightly more sophisticated version of the same problem that experts fall for." - Amos Tverski
